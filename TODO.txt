- modify the user model in prisma and add role property
- regenrate the client
- push the change to the db
- extend the session to contain that info
- display admin or user depending on that info

Subscriptions 
- need to add column eto the database to store subscription status
- default for all users is to be free - always render the free gemini component 
- AFTER the user completes the subscription process, stripe will tell our /api/subscription endpoint, and update the subscription status to be equal to the 'nickname' 
- Once the users subscription status is updated, redirect them back to the main app, with the premium component.
